# GeoBlock: Land Ragisteration System
## Overview
- (Submitted at Hacknovate 5.0)
In India, as in many other countries of the world, land registration is an extremely cumbersome and delayed process. Due to the millions of land records that need to be kept up to date, there are an increasing number of fraud instances in the current land registration and verification systems, as well as document loss and court cases. This project was built with the intention of strengthening the land registration procedure and reducing instances of fraud. Since the public ledger contains immutable transactions, the system also makes it possible to validate the lands. Thus, the blockchain-based Land Registration system is a distributed system that will keep track of every transaction that occurs throughout the purchase of land.In addition to expediting the registration procedure, this will benefit purchasers, sellers, and government registrars in transferring land ownership from seller to new buyer.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize land registry, by utilizing blockchain's immutable ledger for enhanced security and eliminating frauds.


## WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM?

In India, as in many other countries of the world, land registration is an extremely cumbersome and delayed process. Due to the millions of land records that need to be kept up to date, there are an increasing number of fraud instances in the current land registration and verification systems, as well as document loss and court cases. This project was built with the intention of strengthening the land registration procedure and reducing instances of fraud. Since the public ledger contains immutable transactions, the system also makes it possible to validate the lands. Thus, the blockchain-based Land Registration system is a distributed system that will keep track of every transaction that occurs throughout the purchase of land.In addition to expediting the registration procedure, this will benefit purchasers, sellers, and government registrars in transferring land ownership from seller to new buyer.


## OUR SOLUTION

We are using unique identification numbers for individual pieces of land. 
Upon transaction the land ownerâ€™s details along with the unique identification numbers is stored into the ledger of blockchain.
Blockchain being immutable and decentralized ,frauds like unlawful land acquisition, money laundering, etc can be controlled.
